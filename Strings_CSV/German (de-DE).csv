At the app start, latest state of books are downloaded from cloud. On opening and closing a book, state of the book is synced again (both upwards and downwards).

Options are provided to control the sync behaviour. With 'All books' option by default all the books are synced, unless user has excluded some books from sync. 'Selected books' means only user selected books are synced. Books can be included/excluded by using the book context menu."
